# NeuWorks

Implementation of classic neural networks: Hamming, Hopfield, and Perceptron.

## Neural Networks

This repository contains implementations of three fundamental neural network architectures:

- **Hamming Network** - Pattern recognition and classification
- **Hopfield Network** - Associative memory and pattern restoration  
- **Perceptron** - Binary classification and learning

## Files

- `hamming.py` - Hamming network implementation with digit recognition
- `hopfield.py` - Hopfield network for pattern restoration
- `perceptron.py` - Perceptron implementation for binary classification

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- NumPy

## Installation

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

Run individual files to see neural network demonstrations:

```bash
python hamming.py
python hopfield.py  
python perceptron.py
```

Each file contains complete implementation with examples and test cases.
